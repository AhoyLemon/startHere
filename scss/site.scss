// General structure adopted from Kitty Giraudel
// https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture

// ABSRACTS are variables and mixins. (they should *never* add lines to the production CSS)
@import "abstracts/variables"; 
@import "abstracts/z-index";
@import "abstracts/mixins";
@import "abstracts/extends";


// BASE is for things like global site styles and typography.
@import "base/reset"; 
@import "base/defaults"; 


// LIBRARIES is for third party Scss 


// COMPONENTS is for stuff like buttons, cards, callouts, toasts, etc... Essentially - reusable rectangles.


// LAYOUT is for stuff like a grid system, topnav, footer, etc.


// SECTIONS is a stripe (like a hero section) - like a component, but bigger.


// PAGES is for any specific page template


// FINALLY, we should have a place for things we still need to get to...
