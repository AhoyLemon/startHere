# There are many boilerplates. This one is mine.

I never set out to create a boilerplate, but after making sites dozens of times, I realized there were familiar patterns I was reaching for, and I'd always copy that code out of my last project. The most recent time, I decided to strip everything out into a boilerplate.

## What is this?
This is the starting point that I ([Lemon](https://ahoylemon.xyz)) use every time I make a new website. It's built using my own aesthetics.

### And what aesthetics are those?
I want to have reusable components to help me make a static HTML site, and I want to do that as quickly as possible. At the same time, I *don't* want to have a whole bunch of boilerplate stuff in the shipped code. The idea here is **only when you need it**: Making something that's slim and extendable.

Also you'll need [Prepros](https://prepros.io). I'm a fan of it, and I avoid NPM whenever I can, so this uses Prepros.

This also assumes you want to write in Vue, Sass & Pug.

### Alright, how do I get started?
1. Click [Use This Template](https://github.com/AhoyLemon/startHere/generate) to use this repo as a project template.
2. [Download](https://prepros.io/) and open up Prepros, add your new project to Prepros and hit the globe button to serve your page.
3. If you see **It works.** in the middle of the screen, congratulations it's working right.

## Fundamentals
I'll break this down into three sections, Pug, Vue and Sass.

2. [Sass](_docs/sass.md)
3. [js](_docs/js.md)
